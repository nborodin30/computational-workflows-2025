In bioinformatics, pipelines are widely used to handle complex analyses such as processing raw sequencing data, running quality checks, aligning reads to a reference genome, and identifying genetic variants. They streamline these multi-step workflows, making them faster, more reproducible, and less error-prone, while ensuring standardized best practices and scalability across different computing environments."
